Chikitsak is an advanced, empathetic medical chatbot designed to help users understand their health conditions. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to analyze symptoms from text and images, provide possible explanations, and recommend when to seek professional medical help. The interface is fully responsive, supports voice interaction, and includes robust chat history management.

## ✨ Features

*   **AI-Powered Symptom Analysis**: Utilizes the `gemini-2.5-flash` model to provide conversational, empathetic, and factual responses based on user queries.
*   **Multi-modal Input**: Users can describe their symptoms via text or **upload images** (e.g., rashes, visible injuries) for a more comprehensive analysis.
*   **Voice Interaction**:
    *   **Speech-to-Text**: A "speak" option allows users to dictate their symptoms using their device's microphone.
    *   **Text-to-Speech**: AI responses can be read aloud, making the app accessible and easy to use.
*   **Full Chat History Management**:
    *   **Persistent Conversations**: Chat history is saved to the browser's `localStorage`, preserving sessions between visits.
    *   **Sidebar Navigation**: All past conversations are listed in a responsive sidebar.
    *   **Chat Actions**: Individual chats can be **renamed**, **shared** (copies conversation to clipboard), and **deleted**.
    *   **Clear History**: A one-click option to clear all saved conversations.
*   **Interactive Feedback**:
    *   **Like/Dislike**: Users can provide feedback on the AI's responses.
    *   **Automatic Regeneration**: Disliking a response automatically triggers a request to the AI for a new, alternative answer.
*   **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern UI that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Loading & Error States**: The UI provides clear visual feedback for loading responses, microphone permissions, and API errors.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
*   **Build Tool**: Vite for a fast, modern development experience.
*   **AI**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for multi-modal (text + vision) chat.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design.
*   **Voice**: Web Speech API for native browser speech recognition and synthesis.
*   **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`) for managing component and application state.
*   **Persistence**: Browser `localStorage` for saving chat history.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

This project is configured to run with a standard Node.js and npm workflow.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer recommended) and npm.
2.  A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
3.  An active internet connection.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository or download the files.**
    
2.  **Set up your Environment Variables:**
    This application requires a Google Gemini API key.
    
    *   In the root of the project folder, create a new file named `.env`.
    *   Inside the `.env` file, add your API key like this:
    
        ```
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    
    **IMPORTANT**: The `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore `.env` files, so your key will not be committed to source control.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
